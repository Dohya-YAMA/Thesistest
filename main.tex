    Hi! My name is Dohya Yamamoto. I don't like to write this thesis. I know this place is to write a summary of this paper, but I have nothing to say. Thus, let me use here to greet readers and to write something happened to me yesterday. Actually I took TOEFL for the application for the Graspp (GRAduate School of Public Policy) and got the score of 18 out of 30 for the reading section. This result is significant and robust. Anyway,  please, please do not read this carefully. Thank you.
